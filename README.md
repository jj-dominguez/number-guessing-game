Random Number Guessing Game

Description: Created a very simple number guessing game using HTML and inline Javascript. I learned how to use loops, operators, and functions to return values to the player, end the game when the turns were over or the correct answer picked, and also define functions to both close/disable the game as well as reset it for more turns.
